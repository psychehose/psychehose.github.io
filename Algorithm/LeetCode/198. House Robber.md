You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

순회를 할 때 이 원소를 더할 것이냐, 더하지 않을 것이냐로 결정 -> 하위 문제로 분할할 수 있음.

```
rob[n]은 n까지의 최대값으로 정의
rob[n] = max(rob[n-2] + arr[n], rob[n-1])
```


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int rob1 = 0;
        int rob2 = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int temp = std::max(rob1 + num, rob2);
            rob1 = rob2;
            rob2 = temp;
        }
        return rob2;
    }
};
```
